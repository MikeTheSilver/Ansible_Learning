1. To connect with ansible server you need to have openssh-server service active and running, also do not forget to configure ansible server first!

2. Creat ansible user and install sudo package:
	apt install sudo -y
    adduser --shell /bin/bash --gecos "" ansible

3. Next, add entry for ansible user to sudoers file:
    visudo
    * and add this entry to the file:
        # ansible user permissions
        ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

4. Now login to the ansible server and copy previously generated ssh key to the client machine:
    ssh-copy-id ansible@192.168.1.1

5. To secure ansible account on the client machine you can turn off login option for it:
    usermod -L ansible
