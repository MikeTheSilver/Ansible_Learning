1. Create ansible user with sudo privileges:
    apt install sudo -y
    adduser <example_user>
    usermod -aG sudo <example_user>

2. Login to user and generate ssh key:
    su <example_user>
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install ansible
	ansible --version
    ssh-keygen

3. Let's prepare ansible config file (you can try to check if its configured by typing: ansible --version in terminal)
    sudo mkdir /etc/ansible
    sudo nano /root/ansible/ansible.cfg

    *EXAMPLE FILE CONTENT:
        [defaults]inventory=/katalog/dla/inventory
        remote_user=ansible
        host_key_checking=False
        become=True
        become_user=<example_user>
        become_ask_pass=False
4. Now let's create file which hosts of clients:
    nano /etc/ansible/inventory
    *check inventory file for more information
5. At this moment you can start preparing your ansible playbooks, before that its good to prepare directory for them:
    mkdir /etc/ansible/playbooks
6. To run ansible playbook just type:
    ansible-playbook -i <path to inventory file in this case >
